			<h3>ALLEN IVERSON: MISUNDERSTOOD?</h3>
			<p>
			Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975 in Hampton, Virginia to his single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.

			He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team, while also playing running back, kick returner and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.
