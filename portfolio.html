        <p>
          D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely implemented SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework.[2] In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result.[3] Its development was noted in 2011,[4] as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011.

        <h3>Angular.js</h3>
        <p>
          AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular" or "Angular.js") is an open-source web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC, Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and approximately 8,400 other sites out of 1 million tested in July 2015.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
          AngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack, together with Node.js runtime, Express.js backend framework and MongoDB database.

        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>
          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework,[3] many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices are meant to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js is a distributed development project governed by the Node.js Foundation,[5] and facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
          Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[7] Groupon,[8] IBM,[9] LinkedIn,[10][11] Microsoft,[12][13] Netflix,[14] PayPal,[15][16] Rakuten, SAP,[17] Voxer,[18] Walmart,[19] and Yahoo!.[20]
