			<h2>Biography: <em>Who Am I?</em></h2>
			<p><b>B</b>orn and raised in Oslo, Anne Senstad is one of Norway's most accomplished contemporary artists. After completing her undergraduate education in Norway, Senstad relocated to the United States where she pursued her studies at Berkeley, California and the Parson's School of Design, New York. 
			<br><br>
			<b>C</b>ontinuing the legacy of such Modernist reductive expressionists as Kasmir Malevich and Ad Reinhardt, Senstad acheives an elemental elegance and sophistication in her work. The artist's preoccupation with light and color serves as an overarching theme which unites her prices, regardless of medium.
			<br><br>
			<b>S</b>eries such as her light photographs and neon installations both display and capture multiple facets of light and color simultaneously. Her neon works explore the environmental and transcendent effects of light, as they move beyond physical boundaries, to occupy the entire room in which they are installed with their glow. Similarly, her photographs of pure color envelop the viewer yet thrust outward by reflecting the world and light around them in their glossy expanses.
			<br><br>
			<b>I</b>n addition to Senstad's photographic and neon series, the artist has completed monumental site - specific installations throughout the world. In 2009, Senstad created The Sugarcane Labyrinth, a one acre (4000 square meter) agricultural installation in Theirot, Louisiana. Highlighting farming culture as a path towards urban sustainability, the installation introduces the idea of agriculture as a vital part of the urban environmental infrastructure. The Sugarcane Project also serves as a memorial for those affected by Hurricane Katrina.
			<br><br>
			<b>W</b>idely acclaimed, Senstad's work has been exhibited in institutions and art fairs such as the Zendai MoMA, Shanghai; the Ministry of Culture, Monaco; the Nobel Peace Center, Oslo; the Center for Fine Arts, Brussels; the Munch Museum, Oslo, the Contemporary Art Fair, Sao Paolo; ArtBasel Miami; the Milan Contemporary Art Fair; the Eva Peron Museum, Argentina; and the Houston Center for Photography. She has received numerous awards and grants from prestigious institutions worldwide.</p>
