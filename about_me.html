	<p class="bio">
		A way out west there was a fella, a fella I want to tell you about, a fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's what makes him so darned interesting.

	<p class="about">
		Sometimes there's a man-I won't say a hero, because what's a hero?-but sometimes there's a man.
	</p>
	
	<p class="about">	
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-
		<br/>
		Sometimes there's a man who the man for his time and place, he fits right in there-and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles.
	</p>

	<p class="about">
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and
		the Dude was certainly that-quite
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
		County.
	</p>

	<p class="about">
		...which would place him high in the
		running for laziest worldwide-but
		sometimes there's a man. . .
