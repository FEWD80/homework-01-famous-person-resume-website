		 <h3> Jean-Michel Basquiat's CV Sold for $50,000 </h3>

		 <p>

		 A two-page handwritten document by iconic artist Jean-Michel Basquiat has sold at Sotheby's for $50,000 USD (approx. Â£32,000). Created by Basquiat when he was 20 years old, the document acts as a comical curriculum vitae on which the artist lists his education, published interviews, and a list of references that include notable figures such as Andy Warhol, Tennessee Williams, and Dick Tracy. The "education" title has been purposefully misspelled, crossed out, and then re-written below alongside the word "NIL". Experience has also been scribbled out and Employment has been thoroughly covered up with a rubber stamp and ink, although you can still make out the name Patricia Fields (an American fashion designer). The piece sold at a Sotheby's selling exhibition called "Man Made", which presented over 30 works by Jean-Michel Basquiat.
