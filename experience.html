		<ul>
			<li>In 1986, Steve Jobs recruited renowned graphic designer Paul Rand to create a brand identity costing $100,000. <em>(Crazy at the time!)</em> Rand created a 100-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28&#0176;) and a new company name, NeXT.</li>
			<li>Paul Rand was a complete badass. Aside from his history-making design fees, he also did not do deadlines. The design would be done when it was done, and he was so confident in his perfect solution that he only presented a single option.</li>
