		<h3>Early Life</h3>

		<hr class="body" />
		<p><strong>June 1946 is when Queens, NYC was blessed with my presence...</strong>since then, the entire United States of America has been. But before I get to that, here's a quick synopsis of all the great things I accomplished between the ages of 1 - 10:
			<ul>
				<li>Escaped from the female body of whom imprisoned my genius for ~ 9 months</li>
				<li>Launched my 1<sup>st</sup> crowd-funded company named <q>My Nuclear Family</q> which provided me with a palatable living situation, emotional support (although rarely needed) and descent meals</li>
				<li>Accomplished a variety of other extremely impressive tasks and blah blah blah...</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		

		<h3>Business Life</h3>

		<hr class="body" />
		<p><strong>You mean just, my life?</strong> There's no real differentiation between my business life and my life - it's all business to me. I mean, you tell me, is there <i>really</i> a difference between a business acquisition and marriage? Owning real estate and having a wife? Get real. So here's just a list of impressive stuff I've done:
			<ul>
				<li>Bought real estate</li>
				<li>Sold real estate</li>
				<li>Made a lot of money</li>
				<li>Bossed people around in real life &amp; on a reality TV show</li>
				<li>Evaded U.S. tax lawes by declaring bankruptcy on real estate I bought - A.K.A. made <i>more</i> money</li>
				<li>Made America great again</li>
			</ul>
