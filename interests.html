			"Now look, your grace," said Sancho, "what you see over there aren't giants, but windmills, and what seems to be arms are just their sails, that go around in the wind and turn the millstone."
			"Obviously," I replied, "you don't know much about <b>adventures</b>."
			</p>
			
			<p>
			"<b>Hunger</b> is the best sauce in the world." 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			"<b>Virtue</b> is persecuted by the wicked more than it is loved by the good."
			</p>
			
			<p>
			"...<b>he who's down</b> one day can be up the next, unless he really wants to stay in bed, that is..." 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			"Take <b>my advice</b> and live for a long, long time. Because the maddest thing a man can do in this life is to let himself die." 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			"A bad year and a bad month to all the <b>backbiting bitches</b> in the world!"
