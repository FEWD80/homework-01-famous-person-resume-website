		<h1>Don Quixote</h1>

		<h4>
		I do not see the world for what it is and prefer <br>to imagine that I am living out a knightly story.
		</h4>
		
		<p>
		I'm a nameless hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), almost 50 years old, who reads so many chivalric romances that I lose my sanity and decide to set out to revive chivalry, undo wrongs and bring justice to the world under the name <b>Don Quixote</b>. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I recruit a simple farmer, <b>Sancho Panza</b>, as my squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with my rhetorical orations on antiquated knighthood.
