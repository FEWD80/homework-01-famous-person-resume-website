		<hr class="body" />

		<p>I'm currently a NYC-born billionaire just trying to <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/" alt="Make America Great Again" target="_0">Make America Great Again</a> by running for President of the United States. For work, I'm a real estate developer who's involved in large, profitable building projects in Manhattan. And for fun, I'm running as President - as I already mentioned.</p>

		<p>
		Deep down, I'm a pretty normal guy with a <i>very</i> normal head of hair. I've got a wife and kids (or so my secretary tells me!) and like do a lot of normal people things - .e.g. sleep, eat, etc. As you can probably tell, I'm a pretty relatable guy!
