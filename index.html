			<b>Robert Anthony Plant</b>, CBE (born 20 August 1948) is an <i> English musician</i>, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. A powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-pitched vocals) have given him a successful solo career spanning over 40 years.
