			<p>Ser Duncan the Tall, was born in Fleabottom King's Landing. He was then known as Dunk and was always very tall for his age.
			He squired for Ser Arlyn Pennytree, a hedge knight, who knighted Dunk right before he died from fever. Dunk went on to compete
			at the tourney at Ashford Meadow where he met a young bald boy named Egg. Egg suggested Dunk call himself the Ser Duncan the Tall to appear more 'knightly'. Dunk then intervened when one of the Targaryean Princes, Prince Aerion, was beating a defenseless girl, and to save him Egg revealed his identity as Aerion's brother Prince Aegon V. After Dunk cleared his name in a brutal trial by combat, Aegon's father Prince Maekar agrees to let Egg squire for Dunk, but only if he keeps his identity a secret. Dunk and Egg agreed and the two went off on numerous adventures throughout Westeros.
