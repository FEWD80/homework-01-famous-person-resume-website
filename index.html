		<p> Kurt Cobain was the most important artist of the Nineties even though he lived for less than half of the decade. When the Nirvana rocketed into popular consciousness in 1991 with "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Cobain became the face and enduring icon of alternative rock. He was a musical genius who (briefly) brought punk rock into the mainstream, and a pop craftsman with a gift for setting simple melodies to noisy feedback and distortion. His coarse and grainy wail was the prototype for later alt-rock singers, and his tangled leads and hurricane-like power chords influenced countless subsequent rock guitarists. In his lyrics, Cobain dealt with the thorny discomfort of growing up and railed about his inner demons. Like Bob Dylan, he hated the notion of being dubbed "the voice of a generation" - in Cobain's case, Generation X - but got it anyway.
