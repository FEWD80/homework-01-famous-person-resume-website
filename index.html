					<p>Hi, I'm Buddy! I'm an elf from the north pole. I used to work in Santa's Workshop with all of the other elfs making toys for Christmas. Now I've decided to go on an adventure to New York City to find my parents. I ran out of money for <i>candy, ice cream,</i> and <i>mapel syrup</i>, so I'd like to start working so I can afford more. </p>
