		<h1>Mother Teresa</h1>

		<hr>

	
		<p Class="box"> People are often unreasonable and self-centered. Forgive them anyway.
			If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.
			If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway.
			If you find happiness, people may be jealous. Be happy anyway.
			The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.
			Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway.
			For you see, in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway.
		</p>

		<p Class="box">
			Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.
		</p>

		<p Class="box">
			Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.
		</p>

		<p Class="box"> I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life?' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did?
		</p>
